    <h1> Skin Cancer in Australia (Asignment 2 FIT3179) </h1>

    <p> Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in Australia, largely due to the country's high levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. 
    </p>
    <p> This dashboard presents key insights into the distribution of skin cancer across Australia, including: 
    </p>

    <br>
    <p> Mortality rates across different states</p>
    <p> Risk of skin cancer according to age groups </p>
    <p>  Diagnosis and survival rates based on cancer stages </p>

    <br>
    
    <p> By exploring these aspects, the dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive overview of skin cancer's impact in Australia,</p>
    <p> highlighting crucial patterns and trends that can help in understanding and managing this widespread disease. </p>

    <hr3>

        <h2>Graph 1: Heatmap of skin cancer distribution in Australia (2007-2020)</h2>
        <p> The heat map shows skin cancer incidents and death cases across Australia (normalised with per 100,000 population), 
            
        </p>
        <p> 
            with a time slider from 2007 to 2020 and menu selection for genders, and types of case.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Queensland and New South Wales consistenly, show the highest skin cancer and death cases,
        </p>
        <p>
            which are explainable with their tropical climate and higher UV exposure levels
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Victoria, South and Western Australia also have significant death and general cases,
        </p>
        <p>
             which might be due to their large and considerable UV exposure
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
           Tasmania also exhibit significant cases per 100,000 population at times, which could be
        </p>
        <p>
            due to its low population but moderately high UV exposure or skin cancer cases
         </p>

        <h2>Graph 2: Bubble chart of Skin Cancer Incidence vs. Mortality by State (2007-2020) </h2>
        <p>
            The bubble plot illustrates the relationship between skin cancer incidence (number of cases) and mortality (deaths) across Australia states, from 2007-2020. Each point
            represents a state or territory, 
        </p>
        <p>
            with the size correspond to its population. The graph is also mapped using a log scale, highlighting that a large number of cases might have 
            relatively lower death rates, 
        </p>
        <p>
            suggesting the effectiveness of early diagnosis and treatment. The time slider and menu slection for gender and skin cancer type provides a more detailed and thorough look at the data/visualisation
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            New South Wales and Queensland show high skin cancer incidence as well as elevated mortality, possibly indicating a significant public health challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Smaller territories like Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory have relatively lower incidence and mortality, likely due to their smaller populations and possibly differing UV exposure levels.
        </p>

        <h2>Graph 3: Line chart for Skin Cancer Mortality Rate by State (2007-2020)</h2>
        <p>
            The line graph showcase the trends and comparisons of Mortality Rate of Melanoma vs Non-Melanoma (Rare Types) between different states, 2007-2020. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The menu selection of cancer type and gender are also featured to help users filtering certain information.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Melanoma tends to have a more stable mortality rate across the states with relatively fewer spikes, 
            which may indicate better management or detection protocols for this cancer type. 
        </p>
        <p>
            States like Queensland, New South Wales, and Western Australia experience this trend over time,
            with generally higher rates
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Non-melanoma skin cancer (rare types) mortality rates are less predictable, with dramatic peaks and drops shown in states such as South Australia, Northern Territory, 
            and Australia Capital Territory,  
        </p>
        <p>
            which might be due to their rarer nature and differences in population size and healthcare response.

        <h2>Graph 4: Radar Chart for Cancer Risk (Diagnosis and Death) In Australia (2007-2024)</h2>
        <p>
            The radar chart represents skin cancer risk of being diagnoised and dying across different age groups in Australia from 2007 to 2024. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Each axis on the chart corresponds to a specific age group, 
            showing how the risk of developing and dying from skin cancer changes as people age. It features functionality 
        </p>
        <p>
            of time slider, gender and cancer type menu selections,to aid the exploring expereince of
            how age, gender and cancer type affect skin cancer risk in Australia
        </p>
        <p>
            The orange region represents the risk of death by cancer, whereas the blue area reflect the risk of being diagnosed
        </p>
    <p>
            through different age ranges
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The largest portion of the chart indicates that individuals from age 40 and above face a greater risk of developing 
        </p>
        <p>
            and dying from melanoma. 
            The risk continues to grow with age, peaking in older age groups 
        </p>
        <p>
            (especially before age 70 and 80), likely due to accumulated exposure to UV radiation over time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The chart shows that the risk of melanoma is relatively low for individuals under age 30, 
            though the potential for 
        </p>
        <p>
            future risk exists, emphasizing the importance of early preventive measures such as sun protection

        <h2>Graph 5: Stacked Bars Chart of Skin Cancer Diagnosis and Survival by Stage and Age Group, 2011 </h2>
        <p>
            The stacked bar graphs show the distribution of skin cancer diagnosis(left) and survival(right) acriss various stages of cancer (I to IV),
        </p>
        <p>
            segmented by different age groups.
            There is also a menu selection for gender so data can be filtered in more details
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Stage I has the highest number of diagnoses and survivors, with the majority of cases occurring in the 60–69 and 70-79 age group.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            This suggests that middle-aged and older adults are most at risk of developing skin cancer, but 
        </p>
        <p> they also benefit from earlier detection and treatment. </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Stage IV represents the least number of diagnoses, indicating that only a small number of cases progress to the most severe stage.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Survival rates also drop significantly in Stages III and IV, iemphasizing the critical need for early diagnosis

        </p>
        <p>
            and intervention.  Later-stage skin cancer presents more challenges for treatment and successful outcomes.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Missing Data Considerations: It is important to note that there is a significant amount of missing data for survival cases in 
        </p>
        <p>
        Stages III and IV. 
        As such, the survival rates for these stages might not fully reflect the true situation. The low survival count could be partially 
       
        </p>
        <p>
            due to incomplete data, rather than only poor treatment outcomes.
