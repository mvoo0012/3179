"1. Where risk (%) estimates are calculated based on counts less than 20 people, the equivalent '1 in X' figure has been suppressed.",2007,,,,,Diagnosis
2. '1 in X' risk estimates can be calculated by performing the following calculation: X = [100 / Risk (%) ],2007,,,,,Diagnosis
3. Risk (%) estimates have been rounded to 4 decimal places where possible. Calculation of '1in X' figures using these rounded estimates may produce results different to the '1 in X' figures above as they are calculated using unrounded risk (%) estimates.,2007,,,,,Diagnosis
4. Lifetime risk estimates are only available from 1982 to 2024 for diagnosis risk and from 1971 to 2024 for death risk under the adjusted for competing mortality framework.,2007,,,,,Diagnosis
"5. Risk of diagnosis estimates are available for most cancers from 1982 to 2020 and projections to 2024 with exceptions to some cancer groups. Reported from 2003 onwards: all blood cancers combined, myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative neoplasms (excluding CML). Reported from 2001 onwards: non-melanoma skin cancer (rare types). Reported from 1997 onwards: chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (including juvenile), other blood cancers, other and unspecified leukaemia, other and unspecified lymphoid leukaemia, other and unspecified myeloid leukaemia, other plasma cell cancers. Risk of diagnosis for endometrial cancer is reported from 2010 onwards and for ovarian cancer (C56) from 1982 to 2020. Projections have not been provided for ovarian cancer (C56). Risk of diagnosis is not reported for sublingual gland cancer and cancer of other female genital organs (C57).",2007,,,,,Diagnosis
"6. Risk of death estimates based on the National Mortality Database (NMD) are available for most cancers from 1971 to 2022 and projections to 2024 with exceptions to some cancer groups. Reported from 1997 onwards: all blood cancers combined, cancer of connective, subcutaneous and other soft tissues, endometrial cancer, Kaposi sarcoma, mesothelioma, myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative neoplasms, myeloproliferative neoplasms (excluding CML), other blood cancers, other and unspecified leukaemia, other and unspecified lymphoid leukaemia, other and unspecified myeloid leukaemia, cancer of the peripheral nerves and autonomic nervous system, other plasma cell cancers, other thoracic and respiratory organs. Reported from 1979 onwards: acute myeloid leukaemia, appendiceal cancer, cancer of the brain and other central nervous system, fallopian tube cancer, other central nervous system cancers, cancer of other endocrine glands, cancer of overlapping and unspecified sites in major salivary glands, cancer of overlapping and unspecified sites in urinary tract, submandibular gland cancer, urethral cancer. Risk of death for chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (including juvenile) is reported from 2013. Risk of death is not reported for sublingual gland cancer.",2007,,,,,Diagnosis
"7. Mortality data from the NMD is not available for the following cancers: all sarcomas combined, neuroendocrine neoplasms, non-melanoma skin cancer (rare types), soft tissue sarcomas, ovarian cancer and serous carcinomas of the fallopian tube, other female genital organs excluding serous carcinomas of the fallopian tube.",2007,,,,,Diagnosis
8. The cumulative count of people diagnosed/deaths is the figure from which risk estimates are derived and only include people whose age at diagnosis/death is known.,2007,,,,,Diagnosis
9. Cumulative number of people diagnosed/deaths for a given age range is the total number of diagnoses/deaths for all ages up to and including the given age range.,2007,,,,,Diagnosis
"10. Data for acute myeloid leukaemia, other and unspecified myeloid leukaemia, other and unspecified lymphoid leukaemia are not comparable to data released in previous years due to a change in the ICD-10 coding of these groups. However, the data within this workbook is comparable between the years presented.",2007,,,,,Diagnosis

"1. Where risk (%) estimates are calculated based on counts less than 20 people, the equivalent '1 in X' figure has been suppressed.",2007,,,,,Death
2. '1 in X' risk estimates can be calculated by performing the following calculation: X = [100 / Risk (%) ],2007,,,,,Death
3. Risk (%) estimates have been rounded to 4 decimal places where possible. Calculation of '1in X' figures using these rounded estimates may produce results different to the '1 in X' figures above as they are calculated using unrounded risk (%) estimates.,2007,,,,,Death
4. Lifetime risk estimates are only available from 1982 to 2024 for diagnosis risk and from 1971 to 2024 for death risk under the adjusted for competing mortality framework.,2007,,,,,Death
"5. Risk of diagnosis estimates are available for most cancers from 1982 to 2020 and projections to 2024 with exceptions to some cancer groups. Reported from 2003 onwards: all blood cancers combined, myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative neoplasms (excluding CML). Reported from 2001 onwards: non-melanoma skin cancer (rare types). Reported from 1997 onwards: chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (including juvenile), other blood cancers, other and unspecified leukaemia, other and unspecified lymphoid leukaemia, other and unspecified myeloid leukaemia, other plasma cell cancers. Risk of diagnosis for endometrial cancer is reported from 2010 onwards and for ovarian cancer (C56) from 1982 to 2020. Projections have not been provided for ovarian cancer (C56). Risk of diagnosis is not reported for sublingual gland cancer and cancer of other female genital organs (C57).",2007,,,,,Death
"6. Risk of death estimates based on the National Mortality Database (NMD) are available for most cancers from 1971 to 2022 and projections to 2024 with exceptions to some cancer groups.

Reported from 1979 onwards: acute myeloid leukaemia, appendiceal cancer, cancer of the brain and other central nervous system, fallopian tube cancer, other central nervous system cancers, cancer of other endocrine glands, cancer of overlapping and unspecified sites in major salivary glands, cancer of overlapping and unspecified sites in urinary tract, submandibular gland cancer, urethral cancer. Risk of death for chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (including juvenile) is reported from 2013. Risk of death is not reported for sublingual gland cancer.",2007,,,,,Death
"7. Mortality data from the NMD is not available for the following cancers: all sarcomas combined, neuroendocrine neoplasms, non-melanoma skin cancer (rare types), soft tissue sarcomas, ovarian cancer and serous carcinomas of the fallopian tube, other female genital organs excluding serous carcinomas of the fallopian tube.",2007,,,,,Death
8. The cumulative count of people diagnosed/deaths is the figure from which risk estimates are derived and only include people whose age at diagnosis/death is known.,2007,,,,,Death
